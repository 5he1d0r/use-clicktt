# Use click-tt

This is an user script for using click-tt instead of mytischtennis.

## Information

The script will activate on the league page in click-tt.
It replaces the links to the group page of mytischtennis with an equivalent group page link to click-tt.
This gives the possibility that you can still navigate to an group page on mytischtennis with an activated script without getting redirected to click-tt.

Further this replaces the links on a club page.

It can handle all associations including the DTTV.

## Setup

**Step 1**  
Install an user script manager, like [tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/), in your browser.

**Step 2**  
Go [here](https://openuserjs.org/scripts/5he1d0r/use_click-tt) and install the user script.
